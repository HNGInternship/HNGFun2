              <h3>What is Hng Internship</h3>
              <p class="lead mb-0">The HNG is a 3-month remote internship program designed to locate the most talented software developers in Nigeria and the whole of Africa.

              Everyone is welcome to  participate (there is no entrance exam). We create fun challenges every week on our slack channel. THose who solve them stay on.

              Everyone gets to learn important concepts quickly, and make connections with people they can work with in the future. The intern coders are introduced to complex programming frameworks, and get to work on real applications that scale. the finalist are connected to the best companies in the tech ecosystem and get full time jobs and contracts immediately.

              <h3>Why the Hng Internship?</h3>
              <p class="lead mb-0">We needed developers in Nigeria, and there were just not enough. We found that telent was hiding in different small locations all over the country - but they needed training and exposure to best practices.

              The initial idea was to simply do a remote internship to find coders. We did not expect 1000+ people would apply to the internship. But we saw stongly people wanted to develop their skills, and it became a mission for us to make this happen. </p>

                <i class="icon-check m-auto text-primary"></i>
              </div>
              <h3>How it works</h3>
              <p class="lead mb-0">The internship is open to everyone. It's a big slack group that anyone can join.

              After joining, everyone is given a simple task to perform. Those who successfully complete it stay. The rest drop out.

              After two weeks, the participant start receiving weekly pay.

              The tasks get more competitive. Teams are created. Friendships are made. More money are given to winners of weekly challenges.

              The internship is not 'work', its pure fun.</p>
