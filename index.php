  <h2>Why the HNG Internship ?</h2>
  <p class="text-secondary mx-5 px-5">We needed developers in Nigeria, and there were just not enough. We found that telent was hiding in different small locations all over the country - but they needed training and exposure to best practices. The initial idea was to simply do a remote internship to find coders. We did not expect 1000+ people would apply to the internship. But we saw strongly people wanted to develop their skills, and it became a mission for us to make this happen.</p>
